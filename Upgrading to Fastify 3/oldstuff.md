Fix the foundation and go upwards

- Document your plan of attack
  - Document the end to end step to step proccess
  - Given me better opportunity to access pain points inside the codebase

- Look at Fastify Test Cases early on
  - Migration guide only held so much information
  - These test cases helped me better understand how the functionality of what I implemented worked in practice

- Have your codebase in TypeScript. I wish I knew more TypeScript
  - Being able to know what types and interfaces I was working with the new version helped tremendously
  - I wish I had even greater typescipt knowledge. Certain things I never used in Typescript before made upgrading parts of the codebase a bit confusing

- Break things down into bite-sized pieces
  - It makes upgrading less overwhelming
  - Allows us to tackle errors in incrementally

- Have local test coverage
  - When finishing up a piece of funcationality, having test cases in the codebase gave me a sense of assurance before pushing
  - It was a great referance to assure the functionality worked as it should
