<!--
Over the course of this presentation, we‚Äôll be going over how we upgraded one of our backend services docs render, which is a service that improves the rendering and versatility of what we‚Äôre able to do for the Microsoft documentation, from Fastify 2 to 3.First we‚Äôll give a brief backstory/disclaimer about our codebase, then go over the 5 lessons/tips learned during the process of the Fastify upgrade. These 5 lessons are the heart of the presentation, and last but not least we‚Äôll then end with a migration summary. Everyone cool with that? Awesome!

# Backstory

<small>Disclaimer</small>

Our Codebase before the upgrade:

  - ‚úÖ TypeScript
  - ‚úÖ Not large <small>*Relative to an enterprise codebase</small> 
  - ‚úÖ Dependencies are all updated

<!--
Let's start on our backstory. Now quick disclaimer for anyone watching this talk. I wanted to talk about our codebase before the upgrade. First off, before we upgraded to Fastify 3, our codebase was already using TypeScript. Certain topics or points in this talk could prove to be a different experience for you if you are not using TypeScript. That's primarily because of us taking advantage of the type system provided both within Fastify and our codebase.

Next, our codebase isn't really that large especially if you compare it an enterprise codebase. I'd say the size of our codebase would be equivalent to maybe the size of Vue 2's codebase maybeee React. Just wanted to highlight that. For individuals who may have a larger codebase the lessons/approaches I talk about may not be applicable to your codebase.

Last but not least. All of our dependencies were current. While upgrading we didn't have to worry much about breaking changes in other libraries. That made the upgrade less complex in comparison to other upgrades I've done in the past on other projects I've been on.

# Lesson One

Understand the breaking changes
- Major Version === Breaking Changes
- Document end to end process 
- Assess possible pain points

<div grid="~ cols-2" style="margin-top: 50px">

</div>
</div>

<!--
Just like with many other libraries and frameworks. Major versioning usually comes with breaking changes. An example would be Vue 2 even Vue 3. Breaking changes aren't always a bad thing, but not understanding why they happen is, in my opinion. If you think  a major versioning upgrade of a library or framework is going to break many parts of your application. Document the end to end process of how you might want to upgrade and assess the possible pain points on your application. For documenting just about anything, I typically open up one note and try to map out what parts or files of the codebase might give me the most trouble. I also reference the migration guide. Fastify actually has one, I recommend you look into if you haven't already.

# Lesson Two

<div grid="~ cols-2">  
<div>

Fix the foundation and go upwards

- Several tries
- Tackle upgrade incrementally
- Less overwhelming


</div>
<div>

```ts {all|1}
fastify.register(render);
fastify.register(engine);
fastify.register(auth);
fastify.register(content);
fastify.register(context);
fastify.register(locale);
fastify.register(error);
```

</div>

</div>

<!--
Next, is Lesson Number Two. Fix the foundation and go upwards. Or in other words, establish a stable foundation and build ontop of that. 

When I joined the team and Microsoft, I took the initative of wanting to tackle the upgrade. 

I tried a standard approach of version bumping and dig into tackling the large list of errors. Turns out that wasn't the best approach. It was so rough I ended up abandoning and deleting the branch. In other words, this took me several tries. I created a fresh branch with and find a different approach. Tackle the upgrade incrementally. Stripping down the app to it's basic functionality fix the foundation and tackle the upgrade in increments. Fastify made it easier because of it's plugin centric architecture. As you can see to the right are some of the plugins we've created, I narrowed down the functionality to a core plugin of our app and went onward from there. Which brings me to a point inside of this. The Plugin System
-->

---

# Plugin System

- Has descriptive error messages
- Function declarations concise
- Easier to understand

<div grid="~ cols-2">

<div>
v2

```ts {all|1-4}
export default fp(function (
  fastify: FastifyInstance,
  _options: fp.PluginOptions,
  done: fp.nextCallback
){
  // code here
});
```

</div>

<div>
v3

```ts {all|1-2}
const appRenderConfig: FastifyPluginCallback =
(fastify, _, done) => {
  // code here
}
// more code

export default fp(appRenderConfig);
```

</div>

</div>

<!-- The plugin system changes were probably my favorite. When upgrading the error messages around plugins were quite helpful. After upgrading our functions became more conscise and easier to understand. Let's take a look. But looking at this, even though the error messages were descriptive, there was still a level of disconnect on my end on being able to truly understand how certain changes worked in the upgrade. Which brings me to my next lesson, which is also a great point of reference. -->

# Lesson Three

Reference Fastify Test Cases

- Migration guide had limited information
- See basic implementations of code
- Skeleton for my function

plugin.test-d.ts:

```ts {all|2|6}
// Testing FastifyPluginAsync
const testPluginAsync: FastifyPluginAsync = async function(instance, opts) { }
expectAssignable<FastifyInstance>(fastify().register(testPluginAsync, {}))

// Testing FastifyPluginCallback
const testPluginCallback: FastifyPluginCallback = function (instance, opts, done) { }
expectAssignable<FastifyInstance>(fastify().register(testPluginCallback, {}))
```

---

# Example


plugin.test-d.ts:

```ts
// Testing FastifyPluginAsync
const testPluginAsync: FastifyPluginAsync = async function(instance, opts) { }
```
<div grid="~ cols-2">

<div>
v2

```ts {all|1|6|7|all}
const siteRoutes: Plugin<
  http.Server,
  http.IncomingMessage
  http.ServerResponse,
  RegisterOptions
> = async function(
    fastify: FastifyInstance
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Site Route Code
  }

```

</div>

<div>
v3

```ts {all|1|all}
const siteRoutes: FastifyPluginAsync = async function(
    fastify: FastifyInstance
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Site Route Code
  }






```
</div>
</div>

---

# Lesson Four
TypeScript, TypeScript, TypeScript..... 

- Expidited workflow
- Better disect errors
- Lowered the bell curve
<div grid="~ cols-2">

<div>

```ts {all|1-7}
  interface Logger {
    fatal(msg: string, ...args: any[]): void;
    fatal(obj: {}, msg?: string, ...args: any[]): void;
    error(msg: string, ...args: any[]): void;
    // ......
  }

```

</div>
</div>

---

# Lesson Five
More Test Coverage
- 70-80% coverage
- Instill more confidence after changes
- Consistency
<div grid="~ cols-2">

<div>

```ts
tap.test('write more tests', t => {
  // Insert code coverage
  // TDD is pretty awesome
  t.end();
});





```

</div>
<div>

```bash

Suites:   1 passed, 1 of 1 completed
Asserts:  1 passed, of 1
Time:     1s
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
File      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
All files |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|

```

</div>
